I have gathered some resources I found as I looked for learning opportunities, please feel free to look at them or message me if you find another one I should add.

Organizations and memberships
======

*   The INCF also has training and learning resources you can access for free at [INCF training space]([url](https://training.incf.org/))
* Cognitive Science Organization (CSS): [Link](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/)

Some of these organizations have special membership prizes for individuals from developing countries and lower income. The INCF, CSS and OCNS have options to request membership fee waivers given that paying the fee would signify an uncoverable financial burden.
