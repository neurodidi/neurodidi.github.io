I have gathered some resources I found as I looked for learning opportunities, please feel free to look at them or message me if you find another one I should add.

Organizations and memberships
===
#### General
  * International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility ([INCF](https://www.incf.org/)).
  * Cognitive Science Organization ([CSS](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/)).
  * Organization for Computational Neuroscience ([OCNS](https://www.cnsorg.org/)).
  * Cognitive Neuroscience Society ([CNS](https://www.cogneurosociety.org/)).
  * Society for Neuroscience ([SfN](https://www.sfn.org/)).
  * Federation of European Neuroscience Societies ([FENS](https://www.fens.org/)).
Some of these organizations have special membership prizes for individuals from developing countries and lower incomes. The INCF, CSS and OCNS can request membership fee waivers given that paying the fee would signify an uncoverable financial burden.

#### Inclusion-focused
  * Women in Neuroscience ([WiN](https://neurowomen.org/)).


Learning and training
===
* At the [INCF training space](https://training.incf.org/) you can find several resources for open science, computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics, coding, neuroethics, and many others, for free!
* At [Neuromatch](https://neuromatch.io/), you can take their yearly courses in computational methods for different disciplines: climate science, machine learning, computational neuroscience, and neuroAI. Additionally, their resources are open-access and completely free for you to use or teach in your classes.
* At [Humai](https://humai.com.ar/), you can find Spanish resources and courses in data analysis, ML and applications to Neuroscience and Psychology. They can work with you to weigh both your current knowledge and goals, and have different courses and career tracks that you can enrol in according to your needs. Plus, they are very active, give away scholarships and offer reduced prices if you show financial needs.

Graduate School applications
===
* [Lucy Lai](https://lucylai.com/)'s PhD apps website has an easy-going introduction and guide to PhD applications in the US.
* [Ya'el Courtney](https://www.yaelcourtney.com/phdapplicationguide)'s PhD app guide is complete, detailed, and US-focused.

Science communicators and academic influencers (mainly in Neuro)
===
Following people inside academia can help you understand what it is about. I suggest you have a look at them, both because of the excitement of their research and because their posts discuss some of their downsides.
* Ieva Andrulytė, MSc, [andrulyte](https://www.instagram.com/andrulyte/) at IG.
* Daniel Toker, PhD, [@the_brain_scientist](https://www.instagram.com/the_brain_scientist/) at IG and his [personal website](https://thebrainscientist.com/).
