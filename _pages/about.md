Hi, I'm a Venezuelan BSc in psychology. I always wanted to be a scientist, and got quite curious about cognition. During my undergrad, I especially liked memory, intelligence and language. During the pandemic I found out you could develop computational models of cognitive phenomena while accounting for their neural correlates. This motivated me to explore fields such as computational cognitive neuroscience, computational cognitive science and Machine Learning. 

Feel free to connect with me, sadly I haven't been able to get a research assistant position but I work on doing independent research and projects with open-access datasets, to build up on my skills and experience.
